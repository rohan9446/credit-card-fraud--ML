# credit-card-fraud--ML
Financial fraud is a major worry in the current digital era since technological improvements
have made transactions easier while creating new criminal activity opportunities. To reduce
losses, preserve confidence, and protect the general stability of financial institutions, fraud
detection in real-time is essential. We will be able to examine enormous volumes of
transaction data to find trends and anomalies connected to fraudulent conduct by utilizing the
power of machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, SVM, SGD classifier,
KNN classifier, Naïve Bayes, Decision tree, Extra tree classifier, random forest, Extra trees
classifier, MLP classifier and stack based model(DT, RF, Extra trees classifier). 

**CLASS IMBALANCE HANDLING**
Address the issue of class imbalance in the dataset, as fraudulent transactions are usually a
small proportion of the total data. Techniques like oversampling, undersampling, or
generating synthetic data (e.g., SMOTE) can be used.
When machine learning is used to detect credit card fraud, handling class imbalances is
important to ensure the model’s effectiveness in detecting fraudulent transactions and the best
approach depends on a particular dataset and machine learning algorithm chosen.
**Under-sampling** seeks to balance the class distribution by randomly removing samples from
the majority group (a non-deceptive task).
**Over-sampling** is the replication of samples from a subclass (the use of fraud) to balance the
class distribution.
**SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-Sampling Method)** creates artificial samples for
minorities by interpolating between existing minority class samples.
In practice, there is no one-size-fits-all solution, and the best approach may vary depending
on the specific dataset and machine learning.
